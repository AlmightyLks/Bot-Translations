# Translations
Hey! This repo holds all translations for the SCPStats bot. If you want it to support your language, then create a new lang file and PR it. You can see more info at https://github.com/SCPStats/Bot-Translations/blob/master/Messages.md. You'll also get a special Translator role on the website if you message me about it

## PLEASE READ
There is a translation called `lang_thislang`, which is set to `English` in `en.lang`. This shouldn't be translated, but instead replaced with the name of the language you are translating. It will be displayed as the language's name under the !lang command.
